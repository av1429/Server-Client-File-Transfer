# Server-Client-File-Transfer
This Python server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients, enabling concurrent file uploads and downloads. Clients can request file lists, download, or upload files. The server uses byte-streaming for efficient data transfer, handles network issues like port reuse, and provides real-time feedback.
